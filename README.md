This repository demonstrates a common mistake when using `document.getElementsByTagName()` in JavaScript to manipulate HTML content.  `getElementsByTagName()` returns a NodeList, not a single element.  Attempting to directly modify its `innerHTML` property will not work as expected. The solution shows how to correctly target and update the inner HTML of the div element.
